    I'm not a certified toastmaster, but I've found I have a knack for oral communication.  I excel at giving presentations (and I'm usually excited to do so).  I also really enjoy (and tend to be good at) communicating technical subjects to less technically-oriented people.  Since a lot of my friends are not programmers, I spend a good bit of time giving a bite-sized overview of some really complicated subjects.
