<p>
    My interest in SABR comes primarily from my interest in baseball statistics (specifically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrmetrics">sabermetrics</a>), 
    SABR also promotes important work in baseball history.  I'm happy to support SABR as a member and while I've only done baseball research for personal projects, 
    I hope to contribute to a SABR research committee one day.
