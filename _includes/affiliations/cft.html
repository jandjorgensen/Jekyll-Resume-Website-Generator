    I'm serving as a <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/captain">Brigade Captian</a> for Code For Tempe starting this month.  Based on the other programmers that join the brigade, we will implement civic apps, open government projects, and/or open data systems to improve the resources available to residents of Tempe.  I'll post an update here when we schedule our first meetup and get our site launched (for now I've been working on a <a href="https://github.com/jandjorgensen/cfa-brigade-template">Jekyll template</a> to make sites created by other brigades easy to launch).
