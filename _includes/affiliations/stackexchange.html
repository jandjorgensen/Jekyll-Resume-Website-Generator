Asking and answering questions on Stack Overflow has helped me develop my programming knowledge, especially with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user:437226+[jquery]">jQuery</a>.  I also spend some time on other Stack Exchange sites and am currently serving as a Moderator Pro Tempore on the <a href="http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com">Raspbery Pi Stack Exchange beta site.</a>
