#Reuse
By all means, fork and reuse my page.  I'd prefer that you leave a subtle link in the footer back to the original, or to the GitHub Repo of the original.  If you use this for commercial purposes, I'd just request fair pricing (e.g. if you charge someone to set up a personal website and use this, don't overcharge them).
