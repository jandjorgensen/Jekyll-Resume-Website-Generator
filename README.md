#Quick-start Guide
I created this template so programmers could quickly deploy a resume-style personal webpage for free using GitHub pages.  This quick-start guide should tell you everything you need to know to use this to create your own page hosted for free on GitHub.  Your only prerequisite is to have a GitHub account--in fact if you use the online editor provided by GitHub to edit the given configuration file, you don't have to download anything.

## Forking and preparing for pages deployment
First, fork this repository.

#Reuse
By all means, fork and reuse my page.  I'd prefer that you leave a subtle link in the footer back to the original, or to the GitHub Repo of the original.  If you use this for commercial purposes, I'd just request fair pricing (e.g. if you charge someone to set up a personal website and use this, don't overcharge them).
