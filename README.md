#Introduction
Originally, I wanted to develop a template that enabled quick and easy deployment via GitHub Pages.  However, GitHub Pages does not support custom plugins and this meant losing some of the customization I was really hoping for.  Unfortunately, what this means for you is you will have to install Jekyll (which means installing Ruby), clone this repository, and then build it locally.  Fortunately, this gives you the freedom to host the site that is generated on a service of your choosing.  I will have a recommended development setup for publishing to GitHub pages below, but first we'll just go over how to generate your static site.

#Reuse
By all means, fork and reuse my page.  I'd prefer that you leave a subtle link in the footer back to the original, or to the GitHub Repo of the original.  If you use this for commercial purposes, I'd just request fair pricing (e.g. if you charge someone to set up a personal website and use this, don't overcharge them).
